= A little bit about Golang

== Slide One

* All things considered, this is solely my point of view
* I've interacted with Go for less than a day, take that into account
* I've quickly gathered all necessary resources to learn Go in just a few hours

== Slide Two

What is it about Go?

* The TypeScript compiler was rewritten in Go, which piqued my curiosity
* Go is often recommended as a go-to language for former PHP developers
* Go can build native binaries with cross-compilation (*rules apply as I discovered afterwards)

== Slide Three

Package/Module system in Go

* Go uses a module system to manage dependencies, similar to npm in JavaScript/TypeScript
* Modules are collections of related Go packages
* The `go.mod` file defines the module's properties and dependencies, akin to `package.json`

== Slide Four

Building with cross-compilation

* Go makes it easy to build binaries for different operating systems and architectures
* Use the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to specify the target OS and architecture

Here's a catch - if your app uses cgo (C language bindings), cross-compilation can be more challenging

* You may need a cross-compiler for the target platform
* Example: `CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o myapp-windows.exe`
* This command builds a Windows binary for 64-bit architecture with cgo enabled

== Slide Five

Making an API in Go

* Go's standard library includes powerful packages for building web servers and APIs, similar to Express in Node.js
* The `net/http` package provides HTTP client and server implementations
* Use the `http.HandleFunc` function to define endpoints and their handlers

== Slide Six

* Example:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "net/http"
  )

  func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
  }

  func main() {
      http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
      http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
  }
  ```
* This code sets up a simple web server that responds with "Hello, World!" at the `/hello` endpoint, similar to setting up a route in Express

== Slide Seven

Migrating from TypeScript/Express to Go

* TypeScript typically uses Express for building web servers, while PHP often requires a web server like Apache or Nginx
* Go, on the other hand, can serve HTTP requests directly without needing a separate web server
* Go's concurrency model (goroutines) is more powerful and easier to use than JavaScript's async/await
* Error handling in Go is explicit, unlike JavaScript's try/catch

== Slide Eight

* Example of a simple Go web server:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "net/http"
  )

  func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
  }

  func main() {
      http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
      http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
  }
  ```
* This code sets up a simple web server that responds with "Hello, World!" at the `/hello` endpoint, similar to setting up a route in Express

== Slide Nine

Go Memory Safety and Type Safety

* Go is designed with memory safety in mind, reducing common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows
* The language provides garbage collection, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation
* Go's type system is static and strong, catching type errors at compile time rather than at runtime
* The use of interfaces in Go allows for flexible and reusable code without sacrificing type safety
