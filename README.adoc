= EB-go

My initial playground for Golang experiments.

I'm hearing about Go all-around. It's time to see what it offers.

- Backend: `/backend` written in Golang,
- Frotnend: `/frontend` written in TS/React and Vite

I really like this setup.

Golang is like TS mixed with Rust. On the other hand, Rust feels like TS mixed with C++ for me.

Really strange combination, I need to explore it further but time and space are bound to laws of physics. ;(


== Presentation (why not)

I've included presentation about this work using `reveal.js` which is awesome but I'd prefer to write it in Asciidoc.

In root of project run:

[shell,terminal]
====
npx reveal.js-online
====

This command starts HTTP server on port 8001 with a small presentation.
